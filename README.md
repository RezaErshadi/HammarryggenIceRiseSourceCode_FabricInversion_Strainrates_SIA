# HammarryggenIceRiseSourceCode_FabricInversion_Strainrates_SIA

This repository contains the primary source code for processing data from HammarryggenIceRise. It serves various purposes, including:

1. **Inverting pRES Data**: The code in this repository is designed to perform data inversion to estimate eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Also plotting the figures. The original code for pRES inversion (method) can be found in (https://github.com/RezaErshadi/ApRES_InverseApproach and https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/1719/2022/).

2. **Estimating Vertical Strain Rate**: Additionally, this repository provides code to estimate vertical strain rates from two consecutive pRES measurements within a single year.

3. **Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)**: The repository includes code for creating a surface velocity model and estimating horizontal strain rates using the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) method.

Please note that this repository may have some missing materials, particularly REMA and Bedmachine data due to their large file size. In such cases please contact us. you can find the original pRES data file and ice core eigenvalues in (file:///Users/reza/Zotero/storage/GVQG83AQ/8095508.html)

Feel free to explore and use the code for your research purposes. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
